**Solving the $100B+ problem of global e-commerce returns, one "Fit ID" at a time.**

---

## 🌍 The Problem
Online shopping has a massive flaw: **Size Inconsistency.** A "Large" in India is different from a "Large" in the US or EU. This leads to:
* **High Return Rates:** Up to 30% of clothes are returned.
* **Environmental Waste:** Millions of tons of CO2 from reverse logistics.
* **Customer Frustration:** Losing trust in online brands.

## 💡 The Solution: NEXA
NEXA generates a unique **Fit ID** based on real-time body measurements. Instead of choosing "S, M, or L", users just share their Fit ID with any brand.

### Key Features:
* **Universal Measurement Profile:** One ID, all brands.
* **Privacy First:** Data stays with the user.
* **Developer Friendly:** Simple API-ready structure for Shopify/WooCommerce.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **Frontend:** Clean, responsive HTML5 & CSS3.
* **Logic:** Lightweight JavaScript for measurement calculations.
* **Vision:** Designed for global scalability.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Measure:** Enter your key body metrics.
2. **Generate:** NEXA creates your unique Fit ID.
3. **Shop:** Use your Fit ID at checkout to ensure a 100% fit match.
